# CNN_P300_classifier

This is a reimplementation of the 5-layer Convolutional Neural Network in [1] with minor modifications. Sorry for the comments written in Chinese as I don't have time to change them into English.

Note that the codes in the `\minFunc` are imported from Andrew Ng's Coursera Machine Learning course homework, to optimize the autoencoder. The codes in `
`\AutoEncoder` are experimental(obsolete) and unneccesary to run the classification.

Data is not included in this repo, you can download it here [BCI Competition III](http://www.bbci.de/competition/iii/)
